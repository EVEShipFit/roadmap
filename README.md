# Roadmap of EVEShip.fit

Development costs time.
So for EVEShip.fit we want to be transparent in what is being worked on, and what is not.

## New features

When you have an awesome idea that you think could be of great value to EVEShip.fit, please file a New Feature request in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/EVEShipFit/roadmap/issues/new/choose).

## Bugs

When you found a bug in EVEShip.fit, no matter what part of it, please file a Bug Report in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/EVEShipFit/roadmap/issues/new/choose).
It might be moved to a specific repository if it belongs there; but that is nothing for you to worry about.
We want to address your problem.
That is what is important.

## Incentivizing working on EVEShip.fit - ISK rewards

As all the time spend on development of EVEShip.fit is time not spend in-game making ISK, we want to incentivize development on EVEShip.fit.
Therefor, for all Features and Bugs that participate, you will see a reply which states how much ISK we estimate we could have made in-game; but are instead spending on the feature.

If you want the development of that feature/bug to be prioritized over playing the game, you can make an in-game donation to the corp [EVEShip.fit](https://evewho.com/corporation/98753333) for any portion of the amount.
Please make sure to mention `issue-<issuenumber>` in the description of your donation.
The ticket will be updated with how much is donated, and anyone is welcome to donate.

Whoever implements that feature, or parts thereof, will be granted the ISK donated to that Feature / Bug (in full; EVEShip.fit does not take any cut).

This way we keep it fun for the developers to improve EVEShip.fit, while you have a way of showing what is important to you.
